#exercise 1 : To make a calculator that performs all the functions + , - , * , / . %

a = 40; #taking input of num1
b = 30; #taking input of num2

#addition of two numbers
add = a+b ;
print("The addition of " , a  , " and " , b , "is" , add);
print("The type of add is :" , type(add));

#subtraction of two numbers 
sub = a- b;
print("The subtraction of " , a , "and " , b , "is " , sub );
print("The type of sub is :" , type(sub));

#product of the two numbers 
mult = a*b;
print("The product of " , a , "and" , b , "is " , mult);
print("The type of mult is : " , type(mult));

#division of two numbers 
div = a/b;
print("The division of " , a , "and" , b , "is " , div);
print("The type of div is : " , type(div));

#modulus of two numbers 
mod = a%b;
